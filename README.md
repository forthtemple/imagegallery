This is a searchable image gallery that is 100% javascript and therefore requires no installation. Just upload the repository to your server and it should work. The repository is based upon [searchable-image-gallery](https://github.com/DelLobos/searchable-image-gallery). The sample gallery in this repository has over 400 stock images I generated using grok. For example it'll have a typical stock image like a 'a barrista making a pattern of a leaf in cup of coffee'. Ive made these images public domain so you can use them how you want.


The way the gallery works is that loads stockimages.json that is located in the root. It holds all the image information including the sentence describing the image and also the image tags. You can modify this json file if you wish to make your own gallery.
