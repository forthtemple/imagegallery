This is a searchable stock image style gallery that's 100% javascript so therefore requires no installation. Just upload the repository to your server and it should work. The repository is based upon [searchable-image-gallery](https://github.com/DelLobos/searchable-image-gallery). The sample gallery for this repository has over 400 stock images I generated using grok. For example a typical stock image like 'a barrista making a pattern of a leaf in cup of coffee'. Ive made these images public domain.


The way the gallery works is that through javascript it loads stockimages.json that is located in the root. This file holds all the image information including the sentence describing the image and also the image tags. You can modify this json file if you wish to make your own gallery.
