This is a searchable image gallery that is fully javascript and requires no installation. It is based upon https://github.com/DelLobos/searchable-image-gallery
This sample gallery has over 400 stock images generated with grok. For example the typical stock images description like a 'a barrista making a pattern of a leaf in cup of coffee'. I have made these images public domain so you can do whatever you want with them.

The way it works is that loads stockimages.json which holds all the image information including the sentence describing the image and also the image tags. You can modify this json file if you wish to create your own gallery.
